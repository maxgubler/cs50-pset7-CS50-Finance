^[0-9]+(\.[0-9]{1,2})?$

And since regular expressions are horrible to read, much less understand, here is the verbose equivalent:

^                   # Start of string.
[0-9]+              # Must have one or more numbers.
(                   # Begin optional group.
    \.              # The decimal point, . must be escaped, 
                    # or it is treated as "any character".
    [0-9]{1,2}      # One or two numbers.
)?                  # End group, signify it's optional with ?
$                   # End of string.

You can replace [0-9] with \d in most regular expression implementations (including PCRE, the most common). I've left it as [0-9] as I think it's easier to read.
